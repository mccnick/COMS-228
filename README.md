# COMS-228

Here is a visual of my COMS-228/hw1 project. It calls four sorting algorithms (Selection, Insertion, Quick and Merge) firstly for 2500 randomly generated points and also reads a file within the main project and creates points from the file, sorts & prints those points and provides the runtime in nanoseconds for each algorithm.
