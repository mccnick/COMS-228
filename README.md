*** VISUALS ***

A visual of my <a href="https://github.com/mccnick/COMS-228/tree/main/src/edu/iastate/cs228/hw1"> COMS-228/hw1 </a> project. It calls four sorting algorithms (Selection, Insertion, Merge and Quick) firstly for 2500 randomly generated points between (-50,50), reads a file within the main project and creates points from the file, sorts & prints those points. The program provides the runtime in nanoseconds for each algorithm.
