# COMS-228

Get ready to scroll.

In this repository are three large programming assignments focused on Data Structures and Algorithms.

Assignment 1) Sorting algorithms. Immediately below is an example. There are four sorting algorithms and a main file that calls them all when reading a specific file to sort. YOu can also have it "randomly" sort any number of points, being realistic, otherwise it will throw a memory exception.

Assignment 2) This was the hardest assignment. Essentially we had to build a Linked List 

Assignment 3)

A visual of my <a href="https://github.com/mccnick/COMS-228/tree/main/src/edu/iastate/cs228/hw1"> COMS-228/hw1 </a> project. It calls four sorting algorithms (Selection, Insertion, Merge and Quick) firstly for 2500 randomly generated points between (-50,50), reads a file within the main project and creates points from the file, sorts & prints those points and provides the runtime in nanoseconds for each algorithm.
