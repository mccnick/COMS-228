# COMS-228

Here is a visual of CompareSorters.java in my COMS-228/hw1 repository. It runs a main program to call four sorting algorithms (Selection, Insertion, Quick and Merge) and also reads a file within the main project and creates points from the file, sorts & prints how many points and provides the runtime in nanoseconds for each algorithm.
