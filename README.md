In this repository are three large programming assignments in my Data Structures and Algorithms course, using Java. I earned an A in the class.

___________

HW1) Score: 90/100 - Sorting algorithms.

HW2) Score 100/100 - Linked List traversal, 800+ lines of code. 

HW3) Score 111/100 - Tree traversal to read archived file message.

Total Score: 301/300.

A visual of my <a href="https://github.com/mccnick/COMS-228/tree/main/src/edu/iastate/cs228/hw1"> COMS-228/hw1 </a> project. It calls four sorting algorithms (Selection, Insertion, Merge and Quick) firstly for 2500 randomly generated points between (-50,50), reads a file within the main project and creates points from the file, sorts & prints those points. The program provides the runtime in nanoseconds for each algorithm.
